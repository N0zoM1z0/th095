# Verified knowledge base

This document stores durable, reusable findings. Keep exact observations,
compiler observations, corroboration, inferences, and unknowns visibly
separate. Address-specific transient work belongs in `.analysis/`; the current
next action belongs in `RE_HANDOFF.md`.

## Target identity

| ID | Class | Durable fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TGT-001 | observed | The supported executable is 696,832 bytes with SHA-256 `bb54f6fc54f0eeffaec416ca9f64aef32b5f59b7427fa5a6579f6538e0eddc07`. | Direct hash of the supplied Japanese executable; `config/target.toml` |
| TGT-002 | observed | The executable reports `Shoot the Bullet. ver 1.02a`. | ASCII string in the verified target |
| TGT-003 | corroborated | 1.02a is the planned final update, published 2006-01-13. | ZUN's official update post linked from the README |
| TGT-004 | observed | PE image base is `0x00400000`; entry point is `0x00486A9D`; relocations are stripped. | PE headers in the verified target |
| TGT-005 | observed | `.text` spans `0x00401000..0x004942A7` by PE virtual size. | PE section table |

## Compiler and ABI

| ID | Class | Durable fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ABI-001 | observed | PE linker version is `7.10`. | Verified target optional header |
| ABI-002 | observed | Rich-header records include build `3077`. | Decoded verified target Rich header |
| ABI-003 | compiler-observed | The pinned tools report compiler `13.10.3077` and linker `7.10.3077`. | `archaic-msvc/msvc710` commit and binary hashes in `config/tools.lock.toml` |
| ABI-004 | inferred | Visual C++ .NET 2003 x86 is the original compiler family. | ABI-001 through ABI-003 |
| ABI-005 | unknown | Optimization, inlining, runtime, EH/RTTI, and floating-point flags are not classified. | Requires bounded compiler experiments |

## Analysis control plane

| ID | Class | Durable fact | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RE-001 | observed | Ghidra 12.1.3 with JDK 21 can import and analyze the target headlessly. | Pinned local bootstrap and attested import |
| RE-002 | policy | Ghidra function extents and names are provisional until reconciled against target control flow. | `AGENTS.md` and `RE_WORKFLOW.md` |
| RE-003 | policy | Mapping, origin, source presence, semantic acceptance, and exactness are separate ledgers. | Config schemas and tracking validator |
| RE-004 | observed | The initial attested import exported 1,830 `.text` function candidates. | `scripts/ghidra.py import`; generated ledgers |
| RE-005 | tool-observed | Objdiff 3.8.0 renders an empty zero-unit project as 100%; this is not progress. | Target-independent empty-project smoke report |

## Reference provenance

The initial repository model was compared against local ignored clones at:

- `N0zoM1z0/th105` commit `4afbe8430973571b78b06a97ca351de2a9412994`;
- `N0zoM1z0/th08` commit `b6d8877ccbff7de534c02ab2c6a811345496412e`.

These revisions explain workflow provenance only. They do not establish a
single TH095 code, layout, or behavior claim.
