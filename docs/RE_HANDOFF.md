# Current reconstruction handoff

This file is the current operational handoff, not a session diary. Historical
closed-lane detail remains available in Git history through commit `b94de8e`;
do not copy old counts or superseded blockers back into this file.

## Authority and preflight

- Target: original Japanese TH095 v1.02a only, SHA-256
  `bb54f6fc54f0eeffaec416ca9f64aef32b5f59b7427fa5a6579f6538e0eddc07`.
- Live semantic backend: the private Ghidra 12.1.3 project driven through
  `scripts/ghidra.py` or the read-only GPT-web `ghidra_call` bridge.
- Ghidra observations, imported names, and function extents are provisional.
  Raw target control flow and independently reproduced compiler/library
  evidence decide durable boundaries and origins.
- `config/functions.csv` owns candidate boundaries;
  `config/function-origins.csv` owns authored/compiler/library state;
  mapping, source presence, and exactness remain separate ledgers.
- Generated `docs/PROGRESS.md` and
  `scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py` are the only live count sources.
  Do not duplicate changing totals in prose.

Before any reconstruction-state change, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-target.py
python3 scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary
python3 scripts/validate-tracking.py --require-target
python3 scripts/ghidra.py check
```

The Ghidra wrapper verifies the canonical file and private program by SHA-256,
MD5, file size, image base, mapped image size, entry point, and six distributed
`.text` samples before every headless operation. Stop on any mismatch.

## Closed origin and boundary review

The frozen 1,000-row post-authored cohort is fully classified under evidence ID
`runtime-origin-boundary-review-2026-09-08`: 908 library candidates and 92
compiler-generated candidates. The ledger now reports zero `review` rows. This
closure changes neither the 697 authored functions nor the 693 exact units.

The reproducible evidence and exceptional cases are recorded in
`docs/BOUNDARY_AUDIT.md` and `docs/KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md`. Replay the closure with:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit-runtime-origins.py
python3 scripts/apply-runtime-origin-review.py
python3 scripts/audit-authored-boundary.py --require-clean-authored
python3 scripts/audit-authored-boundary.py \
  --verify-eh-coff --require-clean-authored
python3 scripts/audit-authored-boundary.py \
  --pointer-stride 1 --require-clean-authored
python3 scripts/audit-eh-cleanups.py --require-all
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*boundary.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_eh_cleanups.py -v
```

The runtime audit reselects the closed cohort by evidence ID, requires exactly
1,000 rows, and reports zero unresolved/ambiguous classifications. The apply
tool is dry-run by default and rewrites both ledgers only with `--apply`.

## Active non-exact authored functions

These functions are source-present and deliberately receive no exact credit.
They are now the only active reconstruction lane:

| Address | Function | Deferred compiler problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00419AE0` | `Controller::GetInput` | Branch-local VC7.1 temporary/register chronology; ordinary declaration, naming, scope, and profile sweeps are closed negatives. |
| `0x0043ECD0` | `AnmManager::DrawInner` | Target emits inline x87 `FRNDINT`; no accepted natural VC7.1 source shape is known. |
| `0x0043FA40` | `AnmManager::Draw2D` | Target emits inline x87 `FSINCOS`; portable source remains non-exact. |
| `0x0043FC60` | `AnmManager::ProjectCameraFacingQuad` | Two inline `FSINCOS` sites plus compiler-local copy/lifetime allocation remain unresolved. |

Do not use assembly, copied target bytes, dead locals, fake source phases,
arbitrary padding, ABI lies, or weakened comparisons to close them.

## Matching checkpoint gate

Before and after each bounded matching experiment:

```bash
python3 scripts/progress.py
python3 scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py --summary
python3 scripts/report-reconstruction-status.py --category review
python3 scripts/validate-tracking.py --require-target
python3 scripts/ci.py
```

The review report must remain empty. Commit the stable review-closure checkpoint
before editing non-exact source, then work on one function and one VC7.1 build at
a time. Do not promote exactness without a reproducible match unit and canonical
100% relocation-aware comparison.
