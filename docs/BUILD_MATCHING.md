# VC7.1 build and strict matching

## Proven toolchain

The target uses the Visual C++ .NET 2003 generation. The pinned compiler and
linker report:

```text
Microsoft 32-bit C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 13.10.3077
Microsoft Incremental Linker Version 7.10.3077
```

Their binaries, repository commit, and hashes are fixed in
`config/tools.lock.toml`. The exact build flags and original object graph are
not yet proven.

## Probe compilation

Require flags explicitly so an unverified default cannot become accidental
project truth:

```bash
scripts/compile-probe.sh \
  .analysis/probes/example.cpp \
  build/probes/example.obj \
  /O2 /Ob1 /GX- /GR-
```

The example flags illustrate invocation only. Promote a profile only after
target control flow and repeated compiler experiments support it.

## Canonical unit requirements

Before adding a unit to `config/match-units.toml`, establish:

- a reviewed target entry and complete accepted extent;
- a durable address/name mapping;
- a natural source implementation and exact VC7.1 compile command;
- the COFF symbol and object that own the emitted body;
- every relocation transformation needed for comparison;
- an input digest or report path that makes the result replayable.

Record exact state only when the complete accepted extent has zero byte
differences. If a compiler-generated jump table, handler, or adjacent tail is
part of the function's accepted unit, encode that extent explicitly rather
than truncating comparison at the convenient symbol size.

## Comparison tools

`reccmp 0.1.6` supplies mapped project comparison and `objdiff 3.8.0` supplies
interactive COFF comparison. Neither tool makes a claim safe by itself. The
configured target hash, reviewed extent, relocation policy, cold rebuild, and
ledger promotion together form the acceptance gate.

Until the first unit schema and comparator are exercised end-to-end,
`scripts/build.py --check` intentionally validates the empty unit graph and
refuses to invent a build recipe.

Objdiff 3.8.0 reports `100%` measures for an empty zero-unit project. Treat that
as an empty-denominator UI artifact, never as reconstruction progress. Only the
accepted ledgers drive `docs/PROGRESS.md` and `resources/progress.svg`.
